## QuickStart MelonLoader

Make sure you have installed the game and at least started the game once before you continue.


1. Download [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)
2. Run MelonLoader.Installer.exe.
3. Click the SELECT button.
4. Select and HouseParty.exe from where the game is installed.
5. Select the latest Version of MelonLoader.
6. Click the INSTALL or RE-INSTALL button.

After this the installation directory of the game should contain a new folder called `Mods`.
This is different to the Mod folder, where textures and other Story mods go!!!!
Then Move the downloaded `Sticky.dll` into this folder and start the game.

Refer to [this document here](https://github.com/0x78f1935/HPMods) for further info on modding House Party.

## Features
- toggle UI with ALT + 5
- Pee on command
- Put hand where you pee to aim

Dont worry if the Hand doesnt work directly, just toggle off and on again, wait a second or two and try again. Sorry for the inconvenience.
